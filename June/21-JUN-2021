we will be hired by services based company-> then you will be assigned to a client project, now again client team will take one more interview for entering into project

3/6 months = without project (bench) = you have not assigned to any project, they will force you to put papers.
go through client interviews and get into a project = are safe zone, client interviews are relatively easy as they want to check for fitment level for that project.
