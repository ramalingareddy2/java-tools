Declaring source files via SourceSets in Gradle
By default Gradle works based on Standardized directory structure based on the java plugins we import, how about if we want to introduces more source directories by grouping together related files to be compiled or packaged.
  
projectdir
|-src
  |-main
    |-java
    |-resources
    |-generatedSource
|-build.gradle

How can we add more source file folders letting gradle compile include as part of the classpath of our application that is where gradle introduced sourceSets.
  
sourceSets {
  main {
    java {
      srcDirs 'generatedSources'        
    }
  }
}

How to work with multi-module project in gradle?
we have broken down our project in multiple war modules, but across the war modules we want to reuse the same core components like service/dao without re-writing in each of the war modules, this can be achieved using multi-module gradle project


integraph
|-src
  |-main
    |-java
    |-resources
    |-webapp
      |-WEB-INF
|-coreapi
  |-src
  |-main
    |-java
    |-resources
  |-build.gradle
|-build.gradle  
|-settings.gradle

settings.gradle is a configuration file that will be executed during configuration phase gradle lifecycle.

settings.gradle
rootProject.name='integraph'
include('coreapi')
  
  

integraph/build.gradle

dependencies {
  compile project:('coreapi')
}
